Start / setup (one-time)

Open a Terminal and run these to ensure environment is ready:

cd ~/Desktop/distributed_booking
source venv/bin/activate
# confirm files exist
ls -la booking_pb2*.py nodes client llm node_node1.json node_node2.json node_node3.json


Expected: you see booking_pb2.py, booking_pb2_grpc.py, nodes/, client/, llm/, and the three node_nodeX.json files (or they will be created when nodes first run).
